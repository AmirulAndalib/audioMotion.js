### Source selection

<img src="img/UI_source.png" class="img-right">

Toggles between using the app's own media player or your microphone as the audio source for the analyzer.

If your sound card and operating system support *Stereo mix* mode, it should also appear as an input device option when you set the Source to **MIC.**<br>
*Stereo mix* allows audioMotion to receive audio generated by any program running in your PC.

?> When Source is set to **MIC**, output to the speakers is automatically turned off to prevent feedback loop. (See [Speakers and Volume](#speakers-and-volume))

### Player controls

These are your standard media control buttons.

| button | action |
|:------:|:-------|
| ![ui-player-play-pause](img/UI_player_play_pause.png "play / pause") | Play / pause |
| ![ui-player-previous](img/UI_player_previous.png "previous") | Previous track - Hold to rewind |
| ![ui-player-stop](img/UI_player_stop.png "stop") | Stop playback and reset the queue pointer to the first song |
| ![ui-player-next](img/UI_player_next.png "next") | Next track - Hold to fast forward |
| ![ui-player-shuffle](img/UI_player_shuffle.png "shuffle") | Shuffle queue and start playback |
| ![ui-player-repeat](img/UI_player_repeat.png "repeat") | Toggle queue repeat |

Below the player controls you'll find the current track's elapsed time, progress bar and remaining time.

You can drag the progress bar cursor to fast forward or rewind, or click anywhere on the bar to quickly jump to the relative position on the track.

### Speakers and Volume

<img src="img/UI_volume.png" class="img-right">

The **Speakers** switch enables or disables audio output to your speakers or headphones.

When [Source](#source-selection) is switched to MIC, Speakers are automatically turned off to prevent audio feedback loop.
If you're using headphones you can safely turn it on, in order to hear the input audio.

Hover the mouse over the **Volume** knob and use the **mouse wheel** to turn the volume up or down (if the scroll direction doesn't feel natural to you, invert its behavior in Configuration > General settings).

Volume can also be adjusted with the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys.

### File Explorer

The **File Explorer** allows you to navigate through your media folders and files.

!> Access to your device is provided to the app by the [File System Access API](https://caniuse.com/native-filesystem-api),
which is currently **only implemented on Chromium-based browsers** (e.g., Chrome, Opera and Edge).
On **Brave browser** it needs to be enabled in `chrome://flags/#file-system-access-api` (copy and paste it in the address bar).

**Double-click** a file to quickly add it to the play queue. It will also start playing if the player is currently stopped.

Hold **Ctrl** and click to select multiple files, or **Shift** + click to select a range of files.

You can then **drag and drop** the selected files into the play queue, or use the action buttons:

| button | action |
|:------:|:-------|
**Switch to<br>Server / Device** | Switches between browsing folders on your local device or the songs hosted on the app server
**Add selected**  | Add currently selected files in the file explorer to the play queue
**Add all files** | Add all files in the current folder to the play queue
**Add from URL**  | Load a remote audio file or stream from an URL
**Open file**     | Open and play a single media file from your device<br>*(Only displayed on browsers with no support for the File System Access API)*

?> The first image found in the current folder will be shown in the background of the file explorer, with precedence given to filenames containing the words *cover*,
*folder* or *front* (in this order).

### Play queue and saved playlists

**Double-click** a queued song to play it.

Drag and drop songs to reorder them inside the queue. Hold **Ctrl** and click to select multiple files, or **Shift** + click to select a range.
Press **Delete** (*Backspace* on Mac) to remove selected songs from the queue.

Click the **Clear** button to clear the play queue.

The contents of the play queue are automatically restored the next time you open audioMotion. You can disable this feature in [Config - General settings](#general-settings).

**You can also save the play queue to internal named playlists for quick access.**

Saved playlists appear in the playlist selection box, as shown below:

![internal-playlists](img/internal-playlists.png)

Create and manage your playlists using the following buttons:

| Button | Action |
|:-------|:-------|
**Save as...** | Saves the current queue contents to a new playlist
**Save**       | **Update the selected playlist** with the current queue contents
**Load**       | Load the selected playlist, **adding** its contents to the end of the current queue
**Delete**     | Permanently delete the selected playlist

!> Saved playlists are stored in the browser's internal storage and will only be accessible in the same browser they were saved.

### Playlist files

The File Explorer can load playlist files in M3U format (*.m3u* or *.m3u8* extensions), which are basically text files with one filename per line.

The [Extended M3U format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U#Extended_M3U)'s `#EXTINF` and `#EXTALB` directives are also supported,
and allow adding artist names, album and song titles for media files that don't have embedded metadada.

Playlist entries may include folder names, including `..` to access upper-level folders, but **all paths must be relative to the location of the .m3u file itself,**
i.e., paths **must not** start with a slash or drive letter.

Playlists can also include remote media files and streams, using **https://** protocol.

Example of an .m3u file:

```
#EXTM3U
#
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U#Extended_M3U for format reference.
#
# Note: EXTALB is applied to all songs that come after it, no need to repeat it.
#
#EXTALB:Animals (1977)
#EXTINF:84,Pink Floyd - Pigs on the Wing. Part 1
track01.mp3
#EXTINF:1025,Pink Floyd - Dogs
track02.mp3
#EXTINF:686,Pink Floyd - Pigs (Three Different Ones)
track03.mp3
#EXTINF:619,Pink Floyd - Sheep
track04.mp3
#EXTINF:85,Pink Floyd - Pigs on the Wing. Part 2
track05.mp3
```

### Subtitles

**audioMotion** can display subtitles in WebVTT format (.vtt), for video and audio files.

![screenshot4](img/screenshot4.jpg)

**Subtitle files must be in the same folder and have the same base name of its corresponding media file, with a lowercase .vtt extension.**

Media files with detected subtitles will show a **[SUBS]** badge next to their names in the File Explorer, as shown below:

![file-explorer-subs](img/file-explorer-subs.png)

Configure the subtitles appearance in **[Config - Subtitles configuration](#subtitles-configuration).** Toggle the display of subtitles with the [**SUBTITLES** switch](#display).

?> Download synced lyrics for your songs with [LRCGET](https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrcget) and use [Subtitle Edit](https://github.com/SubtitleEdit/subtitleedit)
to convert them (and other popular subtitle formats) to .vtt.

## Settings Panel

Click **Settings** in the panel selection buttons to open the Settings Panel.

![ui-buttons-settings](img/UI_main_buttons_settings.png)

You can choose which settings may be changed by Randomize in [Configuration > Randomize settings](#randomize-settings).

### Analyzer Mode

<div class="settings-panel highlight-mode"></div>

Selects the visualization mode. Keyboard shortcut: **M** / **Shift + M**.

| Analyzer&nbsp;Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Bars** | When [Frequency Scale](#frequency-scale) is set to **LOG**, each bar represents the *n*th part of an octave, otherwise the frequency spectrum is divided in the number of bands selected by [Band Count](#band-count).
| **FFT** | Displays individual discrete frequencies, as provided by the [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) computation.
| **Graph** | Uses the FFT data points to create an area or line graph - the [line width](#line-width) and [fill opacity](#fill-opacity) can be customized in the Advanced panel.

### Band Count

<div class="settings-panel highlight-band-count"></div>

How many frequency bands should be displayed in **Bars** [analyzer mode](#analyzer-mode), or what octave fraction should be used for each band.

When [Frequency Scale](#frequency-scale) is set to **Log**, this setting defines how much of an octave is covered by each bar.
Otherwise, the frequency spectrum is divided in a fixed amount of bars, with the bandwidth of each bar varying according to the selected frequency scale.

See also [X-Axis Labels](#x-axis-labels).

### Bar Color Mode

<div class="settings-panel highlight-color-mode"></div>

Desired method for coloring the analyzer bars. This property has no effect in **Graph** [analyzer mode](#analyzer-mode).

| Color&nbsp;Mode | Description | Preview ('prism' gradient)
|-----------------|-------------|----------------------------
| **Gradient**    | Analyzer bars are painted with the currently selected [Gradients](#gradients). | ![prism](img/gradient-prism.png)
| **Index**       | Each analyzer bar is painted with a **single color** from the selected gradients, starting with the first color applied to the first bar, and so on, cycling through the available colors. | ![prism-bar-index](img/gradient-prism-bar-index.png)
| **Level**       | Colors from the selected gradient are used to paint each bar, according to its current level (amplitude). | ![prism-bar-level](img/gradient-prism-bar-level.png)

### Sensitivity

<div class="settings-panel highlight-sensitivity"></div>

Adjusts the analyzer sensitivity to improve the visualization of songs too quiet or too loud. Keyboard shortcut: **N** / **Shift + N**.

| **Album cover** | Displays the album cover for the current song<sup> (1)</sup> |
| **Random image** | Selects a random image from the backgrounds folder<sup> (2)</sup> |
| **Random video** | Selects a random video from the backgrounds folder<sup> (2)</sup> |

<sup>**( 1 )**</sup> Album covers will be preferably retrieved from the file's metadata. When a picture is not found in the metadata, **audioMotion** will look for image files
in the song's folder, and will pick any image which filename contains the words *cover*, *folder* or *front* (in this order), or the first image found otherwise.

<sup>**( 2 )**</sup> The web app includes a few built-in background images and videos. **You can select your own backgrounds folder in [Config - General settings](#background-media-source).**
You can also customize [how many files will be directly available](#background-media-max-items) in the selection box, but for large amounts of files use the *Random image* and *Random video* options to randomly choose among **all** files found in the backgrounds folder.

See also [Background Image Fit](#background-image-fit) and [Background Dim](#background-dim) settings for additional options for background images and videos.

You can cycle through the available options using the **B** keyboard shortcut.

**75**  | 75% spacing, 25% bar width

### Fill Opacity

<div class="settings-panel highlight-fill-opacity"></div>

Transparency of the graph area or bar fill. The [ALPHA](#effects) switch, when active, has precedence over the Fill Opacity (for Bars mode only).

Effective only for **Graph** [analyzer mode](#analyzer-mode) or when [OUTLINE](#effects) switch is on.

!> On **Firefox**, Fill Opacity may not work properly with [Radial](#effects) analyzer, due to [this bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1164912).

### Line Width

<div class="settings-panel highlight-line-width"></div>

Thickness of the graph line or outline stroke.

Effective only for **Graph** [analyzer mode](#analyzer-mode) or when [OUTLINE](#effects) switch is on.

### Radial Size

<div class="advanced-panel highlight-radial-size"></div>

Configure the radius of the radial analyzer, when [RADIAL](#effects) switch is on.

### Radial Spin

<div class="advanced-panel highlight-radial-spin"></div>

Configure the radial analyzer spinning speed, when [RADIAL](#effects) switch is on.

### Frequency Range

<div class="advanced-panel highlight-frequency-range"></div>

The lowest and highest frequencies represented in the spectrum analyzer. You can use this feature to "zoom in" a specific frequency range.

### Frequency Scale

<div class="advanced-panel highlight-frequency-scale"></div>

| Scale    | Description | Frequency distribution preview (10Hz - 24kHz range)
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------------
| **BARK** | Bark scale | ![scale-bark](img/scale-bark.png)
| **LIN**  | Linear scale | ![scale-linear](img/scale-linear.png)
| **LOG**  | Logarithmic scale | ![scale-log-ansi](img/scale-log-ansi.png)
| **MEL**  | Mel scale | ![scale-mel](img/scale-mel.png)

Logarithmic scale allows the visualization of proper **octave bands** (see [Analyzer Mode](#analyzer-mode)) and it's also recommended when using the [**NOTES**](#x-axis-label) switch.

[*Bark*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_scale) and [*Mel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_scale) are perceptual pitch scales, which may provide better visualization of mid-range frequencies, when compared to log or linear scales.

### Level Scale

<div class="advanced-panel highlight-level-scale"></div>

**LINEAR**  | Switch between linear scale and decibels (logarithmic) to represent bar amplitudes

### Octave Bands

<div class="advanced-panel highlight-octave-bands"></div>

**ANSI**    | Switch between [ANSI/IEC preferred frequencies](https://archive.org/details/gov.law.ansi.s1.11.2004) and [equal-tempered scale](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Music/et.html) to generate octave bands

### FFT Size

<div class="advanced-panel highlight-fft-size"></div>

Number of samples used for the [Fast Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) performed by the analyzer.

Higher values provide greater detail in the frequency domain (especially for low frequencies), but less detail in the time domain (slower response to changes).
The default value of **8192** usually provides the best cost/benefit ratio for both domains.

### FFT Smoothing

<div class="advanced-panel highlight-fft-smoothing"></div>

Averaging factor used to smooth FFT data between analysis frames.

Lower values make the analyzer react faster to changes, and may look better with faster tempo songs and/or larger FFT sizes.
Increase it if the analyzer animation looks too "jumpy".

### Weighting Filter

<div class="advanced-panel highlight-weighting"></div>

[Weighting filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighting_filter) applied to frequency data for spectrum visualization.

Each filter applies a different curve of gain/attenuation to specific frequency ranges, but the general idea is to adjust the
visualization of frequencies to which the human ear is more or less sensitive.

![weighting-filters-curves](img/weighting-filters-curves.png)

?> Weighting filters **do NOT** affect audio output. Some filters may impact performance, due to increased real-time data processing.
